Software Entrepreneurship course project.

An Android application that acts as a liaison for employers to network with vetted and trained employees to fill in empty shifts. Think of a pool of low-skilled employees from franchises, who would like to pick up extra shift, and employers looking to fill shift and they either don't want to train new employees or do not have the time to fill the shift themselves.
